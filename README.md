    <h1>Translation Dictionary Telegram Bot</h1>
</div>

This is a bot to scrap dictionary website, for now is only using wordreference, but I plan to add more.

Right now, I only have found a slow service to scrap website that doesn't has problems with accent (Apify), but I'm looking forward to finding something better.
